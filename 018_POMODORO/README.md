## Dev Log

### 3-27-2024

New concepts im using in this project:

* timer functionality (`after()` and `after_cancel()` methods)
* dynamic typing

Additional notes:

First decent assignment with `tkinter`. This will be the first app that I believe I will be able to use in my daily life. This will also motivate me to improve and tailor the app to my liking. I am excited to see how it turns out and what ideas I will eventually come up with to improve it in the future.

Update after section:

Not going to lie, that was easy yet difficult. `Tkinter` documentation is not the best so I had to rely on a lot on the 100 Days of Code course to guide me on this one. I was still able to do quite a bit of it on my own, but little things like the `after()` method and `after_cancel()` method were something I had no clue about and both were necessary to complete this project. Regardless, I learned a LOT about `Tkinter`.
