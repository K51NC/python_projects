* Class Definition and Syntax

  * Understanding the class keyword.
  * Defining class attributes and methods.
  * The self parameter in methods.

* Creating Instances

  * Instantiating objects from classes.
  * Understanding how __init__ works for initialization.

* Instance Attributes vs. Class Attributes

  * Differentiating between variables defined inside methods (instance attributes) and those defined within the class body but outside any method (class attributes).

* Method Types

  * Instance methods: Use self to access or modify the object’s state.
  * Class methods: Use @classmethod decorator and cls parameter to access or modify the class’s state.
  * Static methods: Use @staticmethod decorator, neither access the object nor the class’s state.

* Inheritance

  * Deriving one class from another.
  * Understanding super() and how to call methods of a superclass.
  * Overriding methods in a subclass.

* Encapsulation

  * Using public, private, and protected attribute and method access modifiers.
  * Understanding naming conventions (e.g., single underscore for protected attributes, double underscore for private attributes).

* Polymorphism

  * Concept of interface and implementation.
  * How Python allows different object types to be processed in the same way.

* Special (Magic/Dunder) Methods

  * Customizing object behavior with methods like __str__, __repr__, __eq__, etc.
  * Implementing operator overloading through special methods like __add__, __lt__, etc.

* Abstract Base Classes (ABC)

  * Defining abstract classes and methods.
  * Using the abc module to enforce method definitions in subclasses.

* Multiple Inheritance

  * Understanding how Python supports multiple inheritance.
  * Dealing with the diamond problem through the Method Resolution Order (MRO).

* Properties

  * Using the @property decorator to create managed attributes.
  * Understanding getter, setter, and deleter methods.

* Composition vs. Inheritance

  * Understanding when to use composition over inheritance.
  * How to embed objects within other objects.

* MetaClasses

  * Understanding the concept of metaclasses.
  * How classes are themselves instances of metaclasses.

* Decorators and Descriptors

  * Using decorators to extend class functionality.
  * Understanding descriptors and their relation to properties.

* Best Practices

  * Naming conventions and code styling for classes.
  * Strategies for organizing and structuring class code for readability and maintainability.
