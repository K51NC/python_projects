New concepts im using in this project:

* tkinter

Additional notes:

First project using `tkinter`. According to the course instructor, this is where projects become more interesting and really begin to implement GUIs. Not going to go crazy with documentation on this one because it seems like a very entry level `tkinter` project.

It was easy. I just created a similar window to `sample.png`.
