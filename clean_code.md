These are clean code practices I need to begin learning and using in my projects:

* review style guide for the language I'm using
* avoid magic numbers
* use meaningful and descriptive names
* use comments sparingly and make them meaningful
* write short functions that only do one thing
* DRY - don't repeat yourself
* encapsulate nested conditionals into functions
* refactor continuously
* use version control
* SOLID acronym
* YAGNI (you aren't gonna need it)
* KISS - start simple, refactor, add complexity as needed, refactor again
