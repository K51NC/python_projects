These are clean code practices I need to begin learning and using in my projects:

* review style guide for the language I'm using
* avoid magic numbers
* use meaningful and descriptive names
* use comments sparingly and make them meaningful
* write short functions that only do one thing
* DRY - don't repeat yourself
* encapsulate nested conditionals into functions
* refactor continuously
* use version control
* SOLID acronym
* YAGNI (you aren't gonna need it)
* KISS - start simple, refactor, add complexity as needed, refactor again
  * "If you can't explain it to a 5 year old, you don't understand it well enough." I'm going to start doing that with my code. I'm going to explain it to myself like I'm 5 and see if I can understand it. If I can't, I need to simplify it.
