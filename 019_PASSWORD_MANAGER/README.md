## Dev Log

### 3-28-2024

New concepts im using in this project:

* more `tkinter`
  * `columnspan`
  * clearing `Entry` fields
  * `messagebox`
* `pyperclip`

Additional notes:

`Tkinter` documentation is not the best. Again, I was able to do most of it on my own, but there are things that ended up wasting my time rather than teaching me new things. Regardless, I learning a lot with this one and I might head back over to the `018_POMODORO` project to add a popup window for the break time so I stop missing it.
