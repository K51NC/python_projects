# Python Projects for Practice

I have learned the basics of various programming/scripting languages over the years but never had to use any on a daily basis. This repo is for my various python projects and is the result of me going back to learn python. This also allows me to track improvements of my code over time. I am attempting to complete all of the projects from "100 days of code" on Udemy before I am given any solutions in the course. This is to ensure I am not just copying and pasting code but actually using my problem solving skills to figure it out. Afterwards, I can watch the solutions to see what I missed or can improve on. Additionally, I am making some of the projects much more extensive than the course requires to challenge myself.

Although these will mostly be simple learning projects, I will be keeping them here so I can "buff" them later. As an example, 001_TIP_CALCULATOR is my first entry into this repo. It is only a few simple lines of code but I will keep it here to potentially update it later into something more robust as my skills improve and my collection of projects grows.

```Send me a DM on "Twitter/X" @K51NC. I love constructive criticism and feedback. If you see something that can be improved, please let me know. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things. Please keep in mind that I am still learning and some things may be beyond my current skill level.```
