I have coded with various languages over the years and never had to use it on a daily basis. This repo is for my various python projects and is the result of me going back to "relearn" python.

Although these will mostly be simple learning projects, I want to keep them here so I can "buff" them later. As an example, the tip calculator is my first entry into this repo. It is only a few lines of code but I still want it here to potentially update it later into something more robust as my skills improve and my collection of projects grows.
