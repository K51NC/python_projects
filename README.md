# Python Projects for Practice

### 2-21-2024

I have coded with various languages over the years and never had to use it on a daily basis. This repo is for my various python projects and is the result of me going back to "relearn" python. This also allows me to see the improvements of my code over time.

Although these will mostly be simple learning projects, I want to keep them here so I can "buff" them later. As an example, the tip calculator is my first entry into this repo. It is only a few lines of code but I still want it here to potentially update it later into something more robust as my skills improve and my collection of projects grows.
