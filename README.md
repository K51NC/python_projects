# Python Projects for Practice

```Send me a DM on "Twitter/X" @K51NC. I love constructive criticism and feedback. If you see something that can be improved, please let me know. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things. Please keep in mind that I am still learning and some things may be beyond my current skill level.```

*A note about GitHub Copilot:*

I have GitHub Copilot turned off for all of these projects. I am using these projects to learn and improve my skills. I will be going back through the projects later to create second versions (e.g. 009_2_HIGHER_LOWER) where GitHub Copilot is turned on to see how efficient I can make the programs. GitHub Copilot is a great tool for programming and these second versions will give me experience with it for when I use it in an actual production environment.

*My Background:*

I have learned the basics of various programming/scripting languages but never had to use any on a daily basis in my previous 10 years of IT experience so I tend to learn basics, then forget. This repo is for my various python projects and is the result of me going back to learn python. This also allows me to track improvements of my code over time.

I am completing all of the projects from "100 days of code" on Udemy before I am given any solutions in the course. This is to ensure I am not just copying and pasting code but actually using my problem solving skills to figure it out. Afterwards, I can watch the solutions to see what I missed or can improve on. Additionally, I am making some of the projects MUCH more extensive than the course requires to challenge myself. As an example, 009_HIGHER_LOWER is a simple project, but I have completely changed it and made it much more difficult. Instead of a standard Higher Lower game, I have implemented databases (as JSON at first) and API calls to get up-to-date data to use in the game.

### 3-8-2024

* updated 009_HIGHER_LOWER to a full working version. Still some other features to add, but those will come later. (see README.md in that folder for more details)

* Facepalm moment... I am just realizing that I have been using incorrect naming conventions. I understand it's part of the learning process. I will try to use the correct naming conventions from now on and go back and update the previous projects in the future.

* Researched a few things about best practices and naming conventions. Adding a "clean_code.md" file to give myself a reference of best practices and to use them with intent in future projects.
