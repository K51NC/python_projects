# Python Projects for Practice

### 2-21-2024

I have coded with various languages over the years but never had to use any on a daily basis. This repo is for my various python projects and is the result of me going back to "relearn" python. This also allows me to track improvements of my code over time. I am attempting to complete all of the projects from "100 days of code" before I am given any solutions in the course. This is to ensure I am not just copying and pasting code and actually learning the material. Afterwards, I can watch the solutions to see what I missed. Additionally, I am making some of the projects more extensive than the course requires to improve my problem solving skills.

Although these will mostly be simple learning projects, I want to keep them here so I can "buff" them later. As an example, the tip calculator is my first entry ("001") into this repo. It is only a few lines of code but I still want it here to potentially update it later into something more robust as my skills improve and my collection of projects grows.
