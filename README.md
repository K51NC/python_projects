# Python Projects for Practice

```Send me an email at josh.o.inquiry@gmail.com with any questions/comments. I love constructive criticism and feedback. If you see something that can be improved, please let me know. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things. Please keep in mind that I am still learning and some things may be beyond my current skill level.```

*A note about GitHub Copilot:*

I currently have GitHub Copilot turned off for all of these projects. I am using these projects to learn and improve my skills. I will be going back through the projects later to create second versions (e.g. 009_2_HIGHER_LOWER) where GitHub Copilot is turned on to see how efficient or fast I can make the programs. GitHub Copilot is a great tool for programming and these second versions will give me experience with it for when I use it in an actual production environment.

*My Background:*

I have learned the basics of various programming/scripting languages but never had to use any on a daily basis in my previous 10 years of IT experience so I tend to learn basics, then forget. This repo is for my "100 Days of Code" projects and is the result of me going back to learn python. This also allows me to track improvements of my code over time.

I am completing all of the projects from "100 days of code" on Udemy before I am given any solutions in the course. This is to ensure I am not just copying and pasting code but actually using my problem solving skills to figure it out. Afterwards, I can watch the solutions to see what I missed or can improve on. Additionally, I am making some of the projects MUCH more extensive than the course requires to challenge myself. As an example, 009_HIGHER_LOWER is a simple project, but I have completely changed it and made it much more difficult. Instead of a standard Higher Lower game, I have implemented databases (as JSON at first) and API calls to get up-to-date data to use in the game.

### 3-8-2024

* updated 009_HIGHER_LOWER to a full working version. Still some other features to add, but those will come later. (see README.md in that folder for more details)

* Facepalm moment... I am just realizing that I have been using incorrect naming conventions. I understand it's part of the learning process. I will try to use the correct naming conventions from now on and go back and update the previous projects in the future.

* Researched a few things about best practices and naming conventions. Adding a "clean_code.md" file to give myself a reference of best practices and to use them with intent in future projects.

### 3-11-2024

* committed 010_QUIZ_GAME full working version. (see README.md in that folder for more details)

### 3-15-2024

* committed 011_SNAKE full working version. (see README.md in that folder for more details)

* I tried to not introduce any new concepts in this project overall. I wanted to focus on modularizing my code and making it more readable. I still need to focus on not repeating code so much. I think I did a better job at separating the classes from one another but they are still VERY messy. I understand I am still learning but I need to get this in check soon. Again, the complexity of code is still high, but I also know that there are better "shorthand" ways to do things. I'm just not there yet. I'll focus on that after I feel like I have all the fundamentals down.

* A lightbulb moment happened today as well. I watched a youtube video about how to "Be a Better Programmer Than 99% of Other Programmers" earlier and a key point stuck out. I started thinking to myself... This makes sense but I don't think I can sit and read an encyclopedia-sized document of information. In short, read the documentation of the modules you're using. They are probably not as long as you think and you'll learn a lot.

### 3-20-2024

* committed 012_PONG full working version. (see README.md in that folder for more details)

* committed 013_TURTLE_CROSSING full working version. (see README.md in that folder for more details)
